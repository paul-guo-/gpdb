Feature: gprecoverseg tests involving migrating to a new host

# The @concourse_cluster tag denotes the scenario that requires a remote cluster

    # TODO: There is a false dependency on PGDATABASE=gptest in our behave tests, so we create it here.

    Scenario Outline: "gprecoverseg -p newhosts" successfully recovers for <test_case>
      Given the database is running
      And all the segments are running
      And the segments are synchronized
      And database "gptest" exists
      And the user runs gpconfig sets guc "wal_sender_timeout" with "15s"
      And the user runs "gpstop -air"
      And the cluster configuration is saved for "before"
      And segment hosts <down> are disconnected from the cluster and from the spare segment hosts <spare>
      And the cluster configuration has no segments where <down_sql>
      When the user runs <gprecoverseg_cmd>
      Then gprecoverseg should return a return code of 0
      And pg_hba file "/data/gpdata/mirror/gpseg0/pg_hba.conf" on host "<acting_primary>" contains entries for "<used>"
      And the cluster configuration is saved for "<test_case>"
      And the "before" and "<test_case>" cluster configuration matches with the expected for gprecoverseg newhost
      And the mirrors replicate and fail over and back correctly
      And segment hosts <down> are reconnected to the cluster and to the spare segment hosts "<unused>"
      And the original cluster state is recreated after cleaning up <down> hosts
      And database "gptest" exists
      And the cluster configuration is saved for "after_recreation"
      And the "before" and "after_recreation" cluster configuration matches with the expected for gprecoverseg newhost
      Examples:
      | test_case      |  down        | spare       | unused | used | acting_primary | gprecoverseg_cmd                               | down_sql                                              |
      | one_host_down  |  "sdw1"      | "sdw5,sdw6" | sdw6   | sdw5 | sdw2           | "gprecoverseg -a -p sdw5 --hba-hostnames"      | "hostname='sdw1' and status='u'"                      |
      | two_hosts_down |  "sdw1,sdw3" | "sdw5,sdw6" | none   | sdw5 | sdw2           | "gprecoverseg -a -p sdw5,sdw6 --hba-hostnames" | "(hostname='sdw1' or hostname='sdw3') and status='u'" |
